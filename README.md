## Process

* I started by defining my idea of what the app should do and look like.
* Proceeded to lay down some wireframes and searching for inspiration on the web. (The color palette is the official Pokèmons one)
* Started defining the skeleton HTML and basic IN-HTML styling using Bootstrap's utilities.
* Redefined the sass as i felt like more customization was needed.
* I then started to define how the actual app's functionality should behave in more detail and put down into code.
* While developing this app i've been investing much of the time prioritizing learning, but i tried to push commits at least twice a day.
